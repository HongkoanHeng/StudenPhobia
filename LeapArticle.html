							<p><b>What does interior design mean to you?</b>
							<p>
							Interior Design to me: atmosphere, characteristic, mood- how people are going to use that space, how do you want people to feel when entering that space. 
							<p>
								<b>What is interior design all about?</b>
							<p>
							When we think of design, the first thing would be draw and draw. People tell you that you 
								have to be good at drawing, you have to be creative, artistic etc. Yes, it would 
								be nice if you’re born with talent. But what if you’re not gifted? Simple, learn 
								along the way. Creativities can be taught, go out see people’s lifestyle, discover 
								new places, learn to observe, look into design magazine, observe how those designers 
								positioned furniture, light, choices of material, finishes of materials, touches of 
								colours, patterns, types/ style of furniture, what goes with and what don’t. An eye 
								for designer is learnt. One thing is that you have to work hard as twice those people 
								who are born with it. It’s going to be a hard journey. But after considering those 
								consequences and you still want it, then do it. 
								<p>
								<b>What are the processes of designing a project?</b>
								<p>
								Process of designing a project: Coming up with concept. Everything can be concept but 
								the concept that has something to do with the particular topic is hard. For example, 
								designing a clothing retail. It is divided into 3 stages.<p>
								Firstly, Predesign. We have to make a case study; digging into their background, 
								getting to know their philosophy, characteristic of their product. Then we create a 
								story line. On top of that, we have to understand their customer target to determine how
								to sell those products. Everything we place in a space always has a reason behind. Then 
								mood board. This is a very crucial step. It is the promise to the client of how the space 
								is going to feel like. It started from placing furniture, colours, material. The we do site 
								analysis. We study the surrounding area, sun path, wind direction, traffic density. This helps 
								to make best use of the space. Second is Schematic design. After we have studied the space, 
								design philosophy and criteria it’s time to put them into its places. Floor plan- basically 
								the arrangement of the space. There are a lot of sketches been done in this stage before 
								process to 3D design. 3D is where we apply the mood board into and play around with the 
								material, furniture, lighting, arrangement etc. The last stage is Design Development. 
								It is where we present the technical plan- sections, elevations, facades, door and window plan, 
								schedule, furniture plan, lighting plan, ceiling plan, basically all those plans that are needed 
								for construction. <p>
							<b>How to know if you really love design?</b><p>
								There is no specific answer to that. Even after I spent 5 years in design field, I am still not
								sure if I really like it. One thing that I can tell you is that you’re already into design that is why 
								you give it a thought because could have thought about law, medicine, or technology. Stop questioning about 
								it. Do some research, see what it is really like, how is it delivered; go to senior- asking their experience
								and their advice. So that you have ideas what to expect. 
							<p><b>Has your passion in interior design changed through out your academic year?</b><p>
								During my first & second year in university, I was very excited to work new projects.
								I could not wait to explore them in whatever possible ways. But not until the third year when 
								I started to lose interest and find it very tiring. You may ask why I held onto it. Frankly 
								speaking, I reminded myself that there was a time I want it so bad that I chose it. For
								whatever happen, I’ll finish that degree and do something else. People said, “Do what you 
								love”, “Follow your passion”, but the problem is “what if you don’t know what you love,
								what if you don’t know what you want”. If ever that happened to you, please don’t let 
								that stress you out. In real life, things do not work that way. Not everything that we
								do is what we love. Give respect to your decision.
